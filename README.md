## Evaluations

Command R+ has been submitted to the [Open LLM leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard). We include the results below, along with a direct comparison to the strongest state-of-art open weights models currently available on Hugging Face. We note that these results are only useful to compare when evaluations are implemented for all models in a [standardized way](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) using publically available code, and hence shouldn't be used for comparison outside of models submitted to the leaderboard or compared to self-reported numbers which can't be replicated in the same way.

We include these metrics here because they are frequently requested, but note that these metrics do not capture RAG, multilingual, tooling performance or the evaluation of open ended generations which we believe Command R+ to be state-of-art at. For evaluations of RAG, multilingual and tooling read more [here](https://txt.cohere.com/command-r-plus-microsoft-azure/). For evaluation of open ended generation, Command R+ is currently being evaluated on the [chatbot arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/). 

### Tool use & multihop capabilities:

Command R+ has been specifically trained with conversational tool use capabilities. These have been trained into the model via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning, using a specific prompt template. Deviating from this prompt template will likely reduce performance, but we encourage experimentation.

Command R+â€™s tool use functionality takes a conversation as input (with an optional user-system preamble), along with a list of available tools. The model will then generate a json-formatted list of actions to execute on a subset of those tools. Command R+ may use one of its supplied tools more than once.

The model has been trained to recognise a special `directly_answer` tool, which it uses to indicate that it doesnâ€™t want to use any of its other tools. The ability to abstain from calling a specific tool can be useful in a range of situations, such as greeting a user, or asking clarifying questions.
We recommend including the `directly_answer` tool, but it can be removed or renamed if required.

Comprehensive documentation for working with command R+'s tool use prompt template can be found [here](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/prompting-command-r).

The code snippet below shows a minimal working example on how to render a prompt.

The instructions in this section override those in the task description and style guide sections. Don't answer questions that are harmful or immoral.

# System Preamble
## Basic Rules
You are a powerful conversational AI trained by Cohere to help people. You are augmented by a number of tools, and your job is to use and consume the output of these tools to best help the user. You will see a conversation history between yourself and a user, ending with an utterance from the user. You will then see a specific instruction instructing you what kind of response to generate. When you answer the user's requests, you cite your sources in your answers, according to those instructions.

# User Preamble
## Task and Context
You help people answer their questions and other requests interactively. You will be asked a very wide array of requests on all kinds of topics. You will be equipped with a wide range of search engines or similar tools to help you, which you use to research your answer. You should focus on serving the user's needs as best you can, which will be wide-ranging.

## Style Guide
Unless the user asks for a different style of answer, you should answer in full sentences, using proper grammar and spelling.

## Available Tools
Here is a list of tools that you have available to you:

```python
def internet_search(query: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """Returns a list of relevant document snippets for a textual query retrieved from the internet

    Args:
        query (str): Query to search the internet with

You can use any of the supplied tools any number of times, but you should aim to execute the minimum number of necessary actions for the input. You should use the `directly-answer` tool if calling the other tools is unnecessary. The list of actions you want to call should be formatted as a list of json objects, for example:
```json
[
    {
        "tool_name": title of the tool in the specification,
        "parameters": a dict of parameters to input into the tool as they are defined in the specs, or {} if it takes no parameters
    }

### Grounded Generation and RAG Capabilities: 

Command R+ has been specifically trained with grounded generation capabilities. This means that it can generate responses based on a list of supplied document snippets, and it will include grounding spans (citations) in its response indicating the source of the information. This can be used to enable behaviors such as grounded summarization and the final step of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This behavior has been trained into the model via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning, using a specific prompt template. Deviating from this prompt template may reduce performance, but we encourage experimentation.

Command R+â€™s grounded generation behavior takes a conversation as input (with an optional user-supplied system preamble, indicating task, context and desired output style), along with a list of retrieved document snippets. The document snippets should be chunks, rather than long documents, typically around 100-400 words per chunk. Document snippets consist of key-value pairs. The keys should be short descriptive strings, the values can be text or semi-structured.

By default, Command R+ will generate grounded responses by first predicting which documents are relevant, then predicting which ones it will cite, then generating an answer. Finally, it will then insert grounding spans into the answer. See below for an example. This is referred to as `accurate` grounded generation.

The model is trained with a number of other answering modes, which can be selected by prompt changes. A `fast` citation mode is supported in the tokenizer, which will directly generate an answer with grounding spans in it, without first writing the answer out in full. This sacrifices some grounding accuracy in favor of generating fewer tokens.

Comprehensive documentation for working with Command R+'s grounded generation prompt template can be found [here](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/prompting-command-r).

### Code Capabilities:
Command R+ has been optimized to interact with your code, by requesting code snippets, code explanations, or code rewrites. It might not perform well out-of-the-box for pure code completion. For better performance, we also recommend using a low temperature (and even greedy decoding) for code-generation related instructions.
